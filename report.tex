\section{Introduction}
The aim was to benchmark two or more schedulers for the linux kernel.
For this purpose, a user-space program had to be written and obtained
data was to be evaluated using an analysis framework of choice.
Here,

\section{Material and Method}
\subsection{The benchmark program}
Sorting arrays of various length. Each array sorting one thread. Each thread
reports start time, end time and runtime. Tasks should take reasonably long.
Use a fixed number of threads. For example 50. Data creation ahead of
processing. Create one long array and copy to new arrays.

length of arrays in assignment order to threads:
increasing
decreasing
steady
random

it was relevant to find a good length of the tasks. One reason is that
for example in fifo evaluation, the order of execution should be know
to make a meaningful evaluation. However, if the tasks take shorter time
than thread creation, synchronization becomes an issue. Otherwise, if a
task takes significantly longer, tasks/threads can just be created in
sequence without synchronization. Synchronization is not straight forward
as many constructs, such as normal conditional locks don't guarantee the
sequence of threads released on broadcast.


\subsection{Data Evaluation}
Data evaluation by R. Same experiment run 10-20 times.
Barchart for 10, 10, 1, - array length, showing three bars for each array length (fifo, RR, CFS).
